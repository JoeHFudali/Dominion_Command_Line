# Dominion Board Game via Command Line

This is a personal project, in which I am taking the acclaimed board game Dominion (owned by Rio Grande Game), and recreating it to be playable on a Command Line. 


## NOTE:

This project is still very early into development, and is ran by one person. The game is NOT in a playable state as of the moment, 
but the plans for this project are quite extensive. Beyond implementing the base game into a Command Line environment, I would like to add many, if not all of the 
expansions to Dominion, create a Deep Learning Dominion player - to use ML techniques to learn how to play Dominion at a high level - beyond the basic playing heuristic
that is somewhat implemented, and eventually move this project from just inside a command line, to a web project, ulitizing Javascript, HTML/CSS, React, and more 
web-based languages/tools. More features are planned as well, but the ones listed above are top-priority after finishing the base game implementation.

## Limitations:

Due to the limiting nature of the command line, I will be changing some aspects on how the game is played compared to the physical version:

**Changes due to utilizing the command line**
1. This will be a singleplayer experience.
2. Elements of the game (Board, Cards, Decks, Etc.) will have a simplified UI (I am not an ASCII artist)
3. E.T.C.


**Other changes**
1. You do not need to play specific treasures during the buy turn, the game automatically will put all you treasures "in-play"
2. The Moat automatically blocks attack cards
3. E.T.C.

Changes are subject to "change" based on what happens with the web-version, and general feedback.
